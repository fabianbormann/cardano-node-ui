## ❤️‍🔥 Motivation

Currently, there is no graphical user interface to start and monitor a Cardano node.

For some testing or development purposes, a personal Cardano node is essential. However, without a simple and streamlined user interface, users must rely on command line tools to set up and manage nodes, which can be time consuming. This can be time consuming. It requires reading lengthy documentation and executing a series of commands in a terminal.

This project aims to provide a one-click solution for starting a Cardano node and monitoring its synchronization progress. By offering an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, we hope to make it easier for individuals and organizations to participate in the Cardano network and contribute to its growth.
